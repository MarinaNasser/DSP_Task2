## Main Idea
### Signal processing, by applying FFT to a signal, control the amplitude of the frequncies within the signal and displaying it after applying Inverse Fourier Transform. 


## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
Fast Fourier Transformation(FFT) is a mathematical algorithm that calculates Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) of a given sequence. The only difference between FT(Fourier Transform) and FFT is that FT considers a continuous signal while FFT takes a discrete signal as input. DFT converts a sequence (discrete signal) into its frequency constituents just like FT does for a continuous signal. In our case, we have a sequence of amplitudes that were sampled from a continuous audio signal. DFT or FFT algorithm can convert this time-domain discrete signal into a frequency-domain.

## Features
* Uploading Csv or Wav type file.
* Contains 4 modes ("Uniform Range Mode", "Vowels Mode", "Musical Instruments Mode", "Biological Signal Abnormalities").
* Displaying orignal and modified audio in vowels and musical insturments modes.
* Displaying static and dynamic plots for the orignal and modified signal.
* A spectorogram for both orignal and modified signals.

## Modes Description 
* "Uniform Range Mode" : the total frequency range of the input signal is divided uniformly into 10 equal ranges of frequencies, each is controlled by one slider.
* "Vowels Mode" : each slider can control the magnitude of specific vowel.
* "Musical Instruments Mode" : each slider can control the magnitude of a specific musical instrument.
* "Biological Signal Abnormalities" : one slider control the normal ECG signal and the other controls the arrhythmia within the signal.

## Spectrogram
Visual representation of frequencies of a given signal with time is called Spectrogram. In a spectrogram representation plot â€” one axis represents the time, the second axis represents frequencies and the colors represent magnitude (amplitude) of the observed frequency at a particular time.
