## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    Fast Fourier Transformation(FFT) is a mathematical algorithm that calculates Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) of a given sequence. The only difference between FT(Fourier Transform) and FFT is that FT considers a continuous signal while FFT takes a discrete signal as input. DFT converts a sequence (discrete signal) into its frequency constituents just like FT does for a continuous signal. In our case, we have a sequence of amplitudes that were sampled from a continuous audio signal. DFT or FFT algorithm can convert this time-domain discrete signal into a frequency-domain.

## Spectrogram
    Visual representation of frequencies of a given signal with time is called Spectrogram. In a spectrogram representation plot â€” one axis represents the time, the second axis represents frequencies and the colors represent magnitude (amplitude) of the observed frequency at a particular time.
